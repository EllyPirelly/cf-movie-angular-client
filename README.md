# MoviePool App in Angular

### What is this about?
This responsive MoviePool App in Angular has been built analogue to previously built [MoviePool App in React](https://github.com/EllyPirelly/cf-movie-client). It is for movie lovers that want to be able to access information about movies and - once signed up - be able to view, update, delete their account. It's the client-side to the [RESTful Movie API](https://github.com/EllyPirelly/cf-movie-api).

This MoviePool App in Angular has been built as a task for Achievement 6 in [Career Foundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/).

### Languages, Libraries, Frameworks, Tools
- Angular, Angular CLI (16.0.3), Angular Material
- TypeScript
- HTML
- SCSS

#### Global Dependencies
- `@angular/cli`

#### Dependencies
- `@angular/router`
- `@angular/material`

#### Dev Dependencies
- `@angular/cli` and all packages coming with this
- `angular-cli-ghpages` - to deploy on GitHub pages branch `gh-pages`

## How to run this?
- clone the repo
- `cd` into project
- `npm install`
- `ng serve` - automatically rebuilds the application and reloads the page when you change any of the source files
- `ng serve --open` - automatically rebuilds the application and reloads the page when you change any of the source files and opens the application in a new tab in your browser `http://localhost:4200/`

## Heads-up: Deployment to GitHub pages
- commands to use with angular cli after installing `angular-cli-ghpages` do not work
- code needs to be build manually, run
```
ng build --output-path docs --base-href /cf-movie-angular-client/
```
- follow: https://angular.io/guide/deployment#deploy-to-github-pages and https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source
- add, commit, push, deploy

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
